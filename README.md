# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my archive of Capture The Flag (CTF) solutions. This repository serves as a knowledge base for security challenges I've solved, featuring detailed walkthroughs, exploit scripts, and post-mortem analysis.

Each writeup includes:
* **Analysis:** How the vulnerability was identified.
* **Strategy:** The logic behind the exploit.
* **Payloads:** The exact code used to capture the flag.
